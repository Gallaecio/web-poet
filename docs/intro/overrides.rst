.. _`intro-overrides`:

Overrides
=========

Overrides contains mapping rules to associate which URLs a particular
Page Object would be used. The URL matching rules is handled by another library
called `url-matcher <https://url-matcher.readthedocs.io>`_.

Using such rules establishes the core concept of Overrides wherein a developer
could declare that a specific Page Object must be used *(instead of another)*
for a given set of URL patterns.

This enables **web-poet** to be used effectively by other frameworks like 
`scrapy-poet <https://scrapy-poet.readthedocs.io>`_.

Example Use Case
----------------

Let's explore an example use case for the Overrides concept.

Suppose we're using Page Objects for our broadcrawl project which explores
eCommerce websites to discover product pages. It wouldn't be entirely possible
for us to create parsers for all websites since we don't know which sites we're
going to crawl beforehand.

However, we could at least create a generic Page Object to support parsing of
some fields in well-known locations of product information like ``<title>``.
This enables our broadcrawler to at least parse some useful information. Let's
call such Page Object to be ``GenericProductPage``.

Assuming that one of our project requirements is to fully support parsing of the
`top 3 eCommerce websites`, then we'd need to create a Page Object for each one
to parse more specific fields.

Here's where the Overrides concept comes in:

    1. The ``GenericProductPage`` is used to parse all eCommerce product pages
       `by default`.
    2. Whenever one of our declared URL rules matches with a given page URL,
       then the Page Object associated with that rule `overrides (or replaces)`
       the default ``GenericProductPage``.

This enables us to conveniently declare which Page Object would be used for a
given webpage `(based on a page's URL pattern)`.

Let's see this in action by declaring the Overrides in the Page Objects below.


Creating Overrides
------------------

Let's take a look at how the following code is structured:

.. code-block:: python

    from web_poet import handle_urls, ItemWebPage


    class GenericProductPage(ItemWebPage):
        def to_item(self):
            return {"product-title": self.css("title::text").get()}


    @handle_urls("example.com", overrides=GenericProductPage)
    class ExampleProductPage(ItemWebPage):
        def to_item(self):
            ...  # more specific parsing


    @handle_urls("anotherexample.com", overrides=GenericProductPage, exclude="/digital-goods/")
    class AnotherExampleProductPage(ItemWebPage):
        def to_item(self):
            ...  # more specific parsing


    @handle_urls(["dualexample.com/shop/?product=*", "dualexample.net/store/?pid=*"], overrides=GenericProductPage)
    class DualExampleProductPage(ItemWebPage):
        def to_item(self):
            ...  # more specific parsing

The code above declares that:

    - For sites that match the ``example.com`` pattern, ``ExampleProductPage``
      would be used instead of ``GenericProductPage``.
    - The same is true for ``DualExampleProductPage`` where it is used
      instead of ``GenericProductPage`` for two URL patterns which works as
      something like:

      - :sub:`(match) https://www.dualexample.com/shop/electronics/?product=123`
      - :sub:`(match) https://www.dualexample.com/shop/books/paperback/?product=849`
      - :sub:`(NO match) https://www.dualexample.com/on-sale/books/?product=923`
      - :sub:`(match) https://www.dualexample.net/store/kitchen/?pid=776`
      - :sub:`(match) https://www.dualexample.net/store/?pid=892`
      - :sub:`(NO match) https://www.dualexample.net/new-offers/fitness/?pid=892`

    - On the other hand, ``AnotherExampleProductPage`` is only used instead of
      ``GenericProductPage`` when we're handling pages from ``anotherexample.com``
      that doesn't contain ``/digital-goods/`` in its URL path.

.. tip::

    The URL patterns declared in the ``@handle_urls`` annotation can still be
    further customized. You can read some of the specific parameters in the
    :ref:`API section <api-overrides>` of :func:`web_poet.handle_urls`.


Retrieving all available Overrides
----------------------------------

The :meth:`~.PageObjectRegistry.get_overrides` method from the ``web_poet.default_registry``
allows discovery and retrieval of  all :class:`~.OverrideRule` from your project.
Following from our example above, using it would be:

.. code-block:: python

    from web_poet import default_registry

    # Retrieves all OverrideRules that were registered in the registry
    rules = default_registry.get_overrides()

    print(len(rules))  # 3
    print(rules[0])    # OverrideRule(for_patterns=Patterns(include=['example.com'], exclude=[], priority=500), use=<class 'my_project.page_objects.ExampleProductPage'>, instead_of=<class 'my_project.page_objects.GenericProductPage'>, meta={})

Remember that using ``@handle_urls`` to annotate the Page Objects would result
in the :class:`~.OverrideRule` to be written into ``web_poet.default_registry``.


.. warning::

    :meth:`~.PageObjectRegistry.get_overrides` relies on the fact that all essential
    packages/modules which contains the :func:`web_poet.handle_urls`
    annotations are properly loaded.

    Thus, for cases like importing Page Objects from another external package,
    you'd need to properly load all ``@handle_urls`` annotations from the external
    source. This ensures that the external Page Objects have their annotations
    properly loaded.

    This can be done via the function named :func:`~.web_poet.overrides.consume_modules`.
    Here's an example:

    .. code-block:: python

        from web_poet import default_registry, consume_modules

        consume_modules("external_package_A.po", "another_ext_package.lib")
        rules = default_registry.get_overrides()

        # Fortunately, `get_overrides()` provides a shortcut for the lines above:
        rules = default_registry.get_overrides(consume=["external_package_A.po", "another_ext_package.lib"])

    The next section explores this caveat further.


Using Overrides from External Packages
--------------------------------------

Developers have the option to import existing Page Objects alongside the
:class:`~.OverrideRule` attached to them. This section aims to showcase different
scenarios that come up when using multiple Page Object Projects.

Using all available OverrideRules from multiple Page Object Projects
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Let's suppose we have the following use case before us:

    - An **external** Python package named ``ecommerce_page_objects`` is available
      which contains Page Objects for common websites.
    - Another similar **external** package named ``gadget_sites_page_objects`` is
      available for even more specific websites.
    - Your project's objective is to handle as much eCommerce websites as you
      can.

        - Thus, you'd want to use the already available packages above and
          perhaps improve on them or create new Page Objects for new websites.

Remember that all of the :class:`~.OverrideRule` are declared by annotating
Page Objects using the :func:`web_poet.handle_urls` via ``@handle_urls``. Thus,
they can easily be accessed using the :meth:`~.PageObjectRegistry.get_overrides`
of ``web_poet.default_registry``.

This can be done something like:

.. code-block:: python

    from web_poet import default_registry, consume_modules

    # ❌ Remember that this wouldn't retrieve any rules at all since the
    # annotations are NOT properly loaded.
    rules = default_registry.get_overrides()
    print(rules)  # []

    # ✅ Instead, you need to run the following so that all of the Page
    # Objects in the external packages are recursively loaded.
    consume_modules("ecommerce_page_objects", "gadget_sites_page_objects")
    rules = default_registry.get_overrides()

    # Alternatively, this could be shortened using:
    rules = default_registry.get_overrides(consume=["ecommerce_page_objects", "gadget_sites_page_objects"])

    # The collected rules would then be as follows:
    print(rules)
    # 1. OverrideRule(for_patterns=Patterns(include=['site_1.com'], exclude=[], priority=500), use=<class 'ecommerce_page_objects.site_1.EcomSite1'>, instead_of=<class 'ecommerce_page_objects.EcomGenericPage'>, meta={})
    # 2. OverrideRule(for_patterns=Patterns(include=['site_2.com'], exclude=[], priority=500), use=<class 'ecommerce_page_objects.site_2.EcomSite2'>, instead_of=<class 'ecommerce_page_objects.EcomGenericPage'>, meta={})
    # 3. OverrideRule(for_patterns=Patterns(include=['site_2.com'], exclude=[], priority=500), use=<class 'gadget_sites_page_objects.site_2.GadgetSite2'>, instead_of=<class 'gadget_sites_page_objects.GadgetGenericPage'>, meta={})
    # 4. OverrideRule(for_patterns=Patterns(include=['site_3.com'], exclude=[], priority=500), use=<class 'gadget_sites_page_objects.site_3.GadgetSite3'>, instead_of=<class 'gadget_sites_page_objects.GadgetGenericPage'>, meta={})

.. note::

    Once :func:`~.web_poet.overrides.consume_modules` is called, then all
    external Page Objects are loaded and available for the entire runtime
    duration. Calling :func:`~.web_poet.overrides.consume_modules` again makes
    no difference unless a new set of modules are provided.

.. _`intro-rule-subset`:

Using only a subset of the available OverrideRules
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Suppose that the use case from the previous section has changed wherein a
subset of :class:`~.OverrideRule` would be used. This could be achieved by
using the :meth:`~.PageObjectRegistry.search_overrides` method which allows for
convenient selection of a subset of rules from the ``default_registry``.

Here's an example of how you could manually select the rules using the
:meth:`~.PageObjectRegistry.search_overrides` method instead:

.. code-block:: python

    from web_poet import default_registry, consume_modules
    import ecommerce_page_objects, gadget_sites_page_objects

    consume_modules("ecommerce_page_objects", "gadget_sites_page_objects")

    ecom_rules = default_registry.search_overrides(instead_of=ecommerce_page_objects.EcomGenericPage)
    print(ecom_rules)
    # OverrideRule(for_patterns=Patterns(include=['site_1.com'], exclude=[], priority=500), use=<class 'ecommerce_page_objects.site_1.EcomSite1'>, instead_of=<class 'ecommerce_page_objects.EcomGenericPage'>, meta={})
    # OverrideRule(for_patterns=Patterns(include=['site_2.com'], exclude=[], priority=500), use=<class 'ecommerce_page_objects.site_2.EcomSite2'>, instead_of=<class 'ecommerce_page_objects.EcomGenericPage'>, meta={})

    gadget_rules = default_registry.search_overrides(use=gadget_sites_page_objects.site_3.GadgetSite3)
    print(gadget_rules)
    # OverrideRule(for_patterns=Patterns(include=['site_3.com'], exclude=[], priority=500), use=<class 'gadget_sites_page_objects.site_3.GadgetSite3'>, instead_of=<class 'gadget_sites_page_objects.GadgetGenericPage'>, meta={})

    rules = ecom_rules + gadget_rules
    print(rules)
    # OverrideRule(for_patterns=Patterns(include=['site_1.com'], exclude=[], priority=500), use=<class 'ecommerce_page_objects.site_1.EcomSite1'>, instead_of=<class 'ecommerce_page_objects.EcomGenericPage'>, meta={})
    # OverrideRule(for_patterns=Patterns(include=['site_2.com'], exclude=[], priority=500), use=<class 'ecommerce_page_objects.site_2.EcomSite2'>, instead_of=<class 'ecommerce_page_objects.EcomGenericPage'>, meta={})
    # OverrideRule(for_patterns=Patterns(include=['site_3.com'], exclude=[], priority=500), use=<class 'gadget_sites_page_objects.site_3.GadgetSite3'>, instead_of=<class 'gadget_sites_page_objects.GadgetGenericPage'>, meta={})

As you can see, using the :meth:`~.PageObjectRegistry.search_overrides` method allows you to
conveniently select for :class:`~.OverrideRule` which conform to a specific criteria. This
allows you to conveniently drill down to which :class:`~.OverrideRule` you're interested in
using.

.. _`overrides-custom-registry`:

After gathering all the pre-selected rules, we can then store it in a new instance
of :class:`~.PageObjectRegistry` in order to separate it from the ``default_registry``
which contains all of the rules. We can use the :meth:`~.PageObjectRegistry.from_override_rules`
for this:

.. code-block:: python

    from web_poet import PageObjectRegistry

    my_new_registry = PageObjectRegistry.from_override_rules(rules)


Handling conflicts from using Multiple External Packages
--------------------------------------------------------

You might've observed from the previous section that retrieving the list of all
:class:`~.OverrideRule` from two different external packages may result in a
conflict. 

We can take a look at the rules for **#2** and **#3** when we were loading all
available rules:

.. code-block:: python

    # 2. OverrideRule(for_patterns=Patterns(include=['site_2.com'], exclude=[], priority=500), use=<class 'ecommerce_page_objects.site_2.EcomSite2'>, instead_of=<class 'ecommerce_page_objects.EcomGenericPage'>, meta={})
    # 3. OverrideRule(for_patterns=Patterns(include=['site_2.com'], exclude=[], priority=500), use=<class 'gadget_sites_page_objects.site_2.GadgetSite2'>, instead_of=<class 'gadget_sites_page_objects.GadgetGenericPage'>, meta={})

However, it's technically **NOT** a `conflict`, **yet**, since:

    - ``ecommerce_page_objects.site_2.EcomSite2`` would only be used in **site_2.com**
      if ``ecommerce_page_objects.EcomGenericPage`` is to be replaced.
    - The same case with ``gadget_sites_page_objects.site_2.GadgetSite2`` wherein
      it's only going to be utilized for **site_2.com** if the following is to be
      replaced: ``gadget_sites_page_objects.GadgetGenericPage``.

It would be only become a conflict if both rules for **site_2.com** `intend to
replace the` **same** `Page Object`.

However, let's suppose that there are some :class:`~.OverrideRule` which actually
result in a conflict. To give an example, let's suppose that rules **#2** and **#3**
`intends to replace the` **same** `Page Object`. It would look something like:

.. code-block:: python

    # 2. OverrideRule(for_patterns=Patterns(include=['site_2.com'], exclude=[], priority=500), use=<class 'ecommerce_page_objects.site_2.EcomSite2'>, instead_of=<class 'common_items.ProductGenericPage'>, meta={})
    # 3. OverrideRule(for_patterns=Patterns(include=['site_2.com'], exclude=[], priority=500), use=<class 'gadget_sites_page_objects.site_2.GadgetSite2'>, instead_of=<class 'common_items.ProductGenericPage'>, meta={})

Notice that the ``instead_of`` param are the same and only the ``use`` param
remained different.

There are two main ways we recommend in solving this.

**1. Priority Resolution**

If you notice, the ``for_patterns`` attribute of :class:`~.OverrideRule` is an
instance of `url_matcher.Patterns
<https://url-matcher.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api_reference.html#module-url-matcher>`_.
This instance also has a ``priority`` param where a higher value will be chosen
in times of conflict.

.. note::

    The `url-matcher`_ library is the one responsible breaking such ``priority`` conflicts
    `(amongst others)`. It's specifically discussed in this section: `rules-conflict-resolution
    <https://url-matcher.readthedocs.io/en/stable/intro.html#rules-conflict-resolution>`_.

Unfortunately, updating the ``priority`` value directly isn't possible as the
:class:`url_matcher.Patterns` is a **frozen** `dataclass`. The same is true for
:class:`~.OverrideRule`. This is made by design so that they are hashable and could
be deduplicated immediately without consequences of them changing in value.

The only way that the ``priority`` value can be changed is by creating a new
:class:`~.OverrideRule` with a different ``priority`` value (`higher if it needs
more priority`). You don't necessarily need to `delete` the **old**
:class:`~.OverrideRule` since they will be resolved via ``priority`` anyways.

If the conflict cannot be resolved by the ``priority`` param, then
the next approach could be used.

**2. Specifically Selecting the Rules**

When the last resort of ``priority``-resolution doesn't work, then you could always
specifically select the list of :class:`~.OverrideRule` you want to use.

We **recommend** in creating an **inclusion**-list rather than an **exclusion**-list
since the latter is quite brittle. For instance, an external package you're using
has updated its rules and the exlusion strategy misses out on a few rules that
were recently added. This could lead to a `silent-error` of receiving a different
set of rules than expected.

For this approach, you can use the :meth:`~.PageObjectRegistry.search_overrides`
functionality as described from this tutorial section: :ref:`intro-rule-subset`.
